# Team Space Tips

## TRUST YOUR MOMENTS OF BRILLIANCE
You know those moments when things suddenly become clear? When some new truth or insight appears, seemingly out of nowhere? That is a wonderful side effect of your creative mind. Trust it. It may take some time to fully understand why you know what you know, but never doubt that you have valuable knowledge that you can use and share. 

## DESCRIBE THE DETAILS
You often make leaps of understanding that others can't quite follow. You can't quite explain them either -- the ideas simply jump into your mind. When possible, let people into your thought process so they can more fully see what you're seeing. Take your time describing the details of what you see. Many people need to have a picture fully drawn to be able to get on the page with you. 

## KEEP BEING YOU
Your sense of responsibility makes you a rock star of reliability. We can count on you to get it done, and done right. Never underestimate the power of this strength. Your continued attention to solid follow-through will keep your reputation clean and invite greater and greater opportunity. 

## START WITH WHAT YOU KNOW
You like to figure things out from the ground up. Be open to what your coworkers offer to share about their processes and knowledge, and then go with your gut. The most solid foundation for you to build from is your own understanding -- what you know for sure. Start there and everything else will come together. 

## LET IDEAS MARINATE
Take time to muse. You need time alone to let your mind live with the things you've seen, and what you've experienced, so it can settle into some sort of shape. This thinking time is vital to your well-being -- without it, you feel confused and on edge. It is also vital for your performance -- it is the ground from which will spring new insights and discoveries. Take it very seriously. You need it. Others don't, and they don't quite understand why you do. So build it into your schedule and stick to it religiously. It doesn't have to be so frequent that it interferes with your daily work. It just has to be predictable -- you are comforted knowing that thinking time is coming.

## EMBRACE SILENCE
Leave plenty of room for silence in conversations. People fill space with information. The less you speak, the more people will reveal to you their strengths, goals, and aspirations.

## COMMUNICATE YOUR NEEDS
The time you take for mulling things over and figuring things out is an important part of what makes you strong. People around you may appear to move faster, and they may try to push you to do the same, but this approach is unlikely to get the best out of you. Share your StandOut profile with your manager to provide a better understanding of how you work best. 

## COME UP FOR AIR
Sometimes, because your mind needs solitude to be productive, you can insulate yourself. This is to be expected. Just make sure that you do come up for air often enough for your people to connect to you. The sense you make of things is exciting to others. They need you to share it with them. 

## BE CRYSTAL CLEAR
Define your area of responsibility clearly. You will always function best when the boundaries of your role and the roles of others are crystal clear. If necessary, write down these boundaries and make them explicit for you and your colleagues. You'll like this certainty, and whether they realize it or not, those around you will benefit from it. 

## SHARE TRUTHS GENTLY
You speak the truth. We can count on you to tell us what you think is right and to tell it like it is. But not everyone is ready for the naked truth -- sometimes it can feel like an attack or judgment. When you find yourself starting a new relationship or you are giving input in public settings, be considerate for the person receiving your message. Tell the truth, yes, but being gentle will go a long way. 

## SEEK OUT OPPORTUNITIES TO MEDIATE
Seek out situations in which people need an objective mediator. Quite soon people will realize that you are a person who uses objective judgments, rather than your own personal goals or preferences, to determine right from wrong. The trusted advisor, the objective leader, the balanced analyst: these are valued roles that you are very well equipped to play. 

## COMMUNICATE EARLY
Be transparent when things are not going as planned. If you have a problem with your solution, communicate the issue as early as you can and explain what you're doing to remedy it. Your candor in the face of a problem is one of your great sources of power. Use it. 

## GET TO KNOW YOUR AUDIENCE
Get to know your audience. Who are you producing for, and have you set up your world so that you are constantly hearing their unfiltered response to your output? "Response" doesn't mean "praise" -- though it might. It means simply their "reaction." Their reaction will be grist for your creative mill. "Which bit exactly are they reacting to?" you will ask yourself. You won't always agree with, or even credit their reaction, but it will nonetheless give you meaty raw material to work with. 

## LEAD WITH CONCEPTS
Develop a few core concepts that you can use to explain why things play out the way they do. In presentations, lead with these concepts. Refine them so that others can easily repeat them. Practice telling stories that bring these concepts to life.  Find examples that reveal different aspects of these concepts. Your concepts are your most powerful "sales" weapon. 

## TAKE A STAND
Do you notice injustices that no one else seems aware of? Are there issues you care about that are not getting enough attention? Use your passion for "doing what is right" to bring visibility and create change in those areas that are important to you. Respectfully and clearly share what you see isn't working and propose your solutions. 

## FOLLOW UP
Your colleagues can always count on you to follow up after the issue has been resolved to see if they are satisfied. This comes so naturally to you that you may miss how much they appreciate this. To draw attention to it, set a time to do it and then do it at exactly that time. This sort of predictable and genuine follow-through is rare. 

## BRING PEACE TO YOUR SPACE
You crave order, and while you may be able to tolerate messes for a while, they will eventually catch up with you. Clearing your inbox or tidying your office space may seem low on the priority list, but taking time to bring order to your space and systems will pay off in the long run. 

## PUT IDEAS INTO ACTION
You generate loads of interesting ideas, but ideas are most valuable not in and of themselves, but when they are for something. You will be at your best when you are able to use your concepts to get to a decision, to help the team move forward. You will be excited only when you can see that people actually acted on your ideas. And when they do, that will inspire you to come up with the next great idea. 

## BE A MEDIATOR
Develop your skills as a mediator. You have a natural talent in this area, but to become an expert at it will take time, practice, and, more than likely, education. There are professional mediation qualifications you can acquire, skills that will help you know how to move others off the rock of their opinion and find a place of common ground. Armed with these skills, you will find yourself better able to navigate through even the most "dug-in" problems. 

## COME WITH QUESTIONS
Before every meeting, design your list of questions. The purpose of these questions is not to find the "answer." Instead, your questions are the spur for creativity and imagination. Ask your questions and then let others run. By the end of the meeting, others will be much more motivated to take your journey with you. 

## FIND YOUR CREATOR EXPERTISE
Are you a **novelty-loving** Creator or a depth-loving Creator? Neither is "better," but you will undoubtedly find yourself pulled more toward one or the other. Try this: If "novelty" is your thing, you will want to cultivate the reputation for learning agility -- "Throw me in and I'll spot the patterns quickly." If you lean more toward "depth," take it upon yourself to show off your expertise in your subject -- learn the jargon; retrieve the latest writings/research/works, and resist the intriguing temptations of other subjects, other "somethings."
